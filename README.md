# InPen (demo)

> Contract ID `21949291` [*(UpWork)*](https://www.upwork.com/ab/f/contracts/21949291)

This Android mobile application development project is to create a mobile app that can be paired with a smart insulin pen via Bluetooth transmission. Please see the UI design PDF file to create the software.
This is a very basic version and will be used for demo only.
So for the app, you need to develop the following:
Login and Sign up with profile creation
Scan QR code on the pen to register
At a Glance
Your current status at a glance, from last dose to active insulin to recent doses.
Dose Calculator
The dose calculator helps take the guesswork out of dosing. Enter your blood glucose and what you intend to eat and the correct dose is recommended, taking into account recent doses to avoid insulin stacking.
Dose Reminder
In addition to the dose calculator, InPen provides you with optional dose reminders, reminders to check blood glucose after dosing, and temperature alerts for your insulin.
Reporting
Reporting lets you easily share your therapy summary with your care providers so you always see the big picture when adjusting your care plan.
Temperature Alert
Temperature alerts limit the chance of extreme heat or cold which could render your insulin ineffective.
